# Blitz Whot :zap:
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a variation of the whot card game with some concepts in mind.
* The well known use of action cards
* The ability to stack cards in a single play based on shape or color (as long as it isn't an action card). This is concept of _stacking_ is what makes this particular variation exciting.

This two concepts makes it possible to make very fast plays with more unpredictability as one play can turn the tables instantly. This also makes the game that having more cards isn't really an handicap and even the playing field.

There are certain nuances that are either ignored or agreed on with those rules:
* Having to have a last card before checking up
* The ability to stack certain action cards to amplify their effects (e.g. pick twos and pick threes)
* What happens when the deck is used up.

## Features
This is what I plan for now
* Game logic system for blitz whot
* Simple UI for demonstraton

Other nice to haves would include:
* Nice interactive GUI with clean animations
* Intelligent game AI to play with computer
* Customizable options for to enable or disable inhouse rules/concepts
